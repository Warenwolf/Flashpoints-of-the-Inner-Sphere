These alternative files may help you if you encounter stutter in your game during time passage when onboard the Argo or during the travel. Basically game will "pause" for second or less when each calendar day passes.

For me and few more testers these modified files removed the stutter. On the other hand they did nothing for the guy who never had issues with it in first place.

Since these files overwrite the original files in the modtech, don't add those if the micro-stutter does not bother you (although I am pretty sure they will not brick the mod).

To add these files to the BEX modpack, drag the "BT_Extended_FPLore" folder and its contents to the MODS folder where your game is installed, overwriting the original files.

In case you forgot to backup the original files (which you should) - you will find the originals in the "flashpointsOrgFiles" folder.

Finally note that the original mod maker of the BEX mod, has not endorsed or encouraged overwriting or changing the original files in his mod - and I give no guarantee that all stutters in the game will disappear if you do these changes.
Some of that is caused by the vanilla game, enabling debug mode, adding cheats, interaction between certain mods, etc, etc (list is endless). I simply do not have resources or ability to do proper Q&A of these changes. They worked for me and two more people and these are all the data points I have.
