Read the text below carefully!

These alternative files may help you if you encounter stutter in your game during time passage when onboard the Argo
or during the travel. Basically game will "pauase" for second or less when each calendar day passes. 

For me and two more testers these modified files removed the stutter. On the other hand they did nothing for the guy who
never had issues with it in first place. 
Since these files overwrite the original files in the modtech, don't add those if the micro-stutter does not bother you.

To add these files to the BEX modpack, drag the "BT_Extended_FPLore" folder and its contents to the MODS folder where your game is installed, overwriting the original files. 

In case you forgot to backup the original files (which you should) - you will find the originals in the "flashpointsOrgFiles" folder.

Note that original mod maker does not endorse or encourage overwriting or changing the original files in his mod - and I give no guarantee that all stutters in the game will disappear if you do these changes. 
Some of that is caused by the vanilla game, enabling debug mode, adding cheats, interaction between certain mods, etc, etc (list is endless). I simply do not have ressources or ability to do proper Q&A of these changes. They worked for me and two more people and these are all the datapoints I have.
