    "Description" : "The declaration of independence by the Free Rashalgue Republic was met by fierce resistance from the Warlords of neighboring Dieron and Pesht, who deployed their forces in an attempt to prevent the Republic from seceding.\r\n\r\nThis was in direct contradiction to the desires of the Coordinator and Kanrei. The military units opposing the newly-formed republic were labeled as Ronin and were deemed traitors by the Combine.\r\n\r\nBy the conclusion of the hostilities by end of 3034, a significant majority of the insurgent DCMS units had either capitulated or been eradicated",
