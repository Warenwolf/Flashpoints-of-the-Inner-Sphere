Local sources confirm the attack, in form of a kinetic strike, took place at a remote facility on Ghenda moon known for extracting precious metals.\r\n\r\nCondemnations have poured in from across the civilized space, as this heinous act has ignited concern about the growing instability in the Periphery.",
