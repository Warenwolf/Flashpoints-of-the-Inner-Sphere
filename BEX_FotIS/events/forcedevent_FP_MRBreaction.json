The footage was undeniable, but as you sat there, both you and Darius couldn't help but wonder how this would all play out.",

To your surprise, the Federated Commonwealth representative backed you as well, pressing ComStar on why their military wing engaged a mercenary lance without prior communication. \r\n\n\nOn the other side, Amos Miller was adamant that it was your company that went rogue.\r\n\r\n In the end, the meeting concluded with a partial censure of your actions. \n\n\u201CTotally unfair, but this is a good outcome, Boss,\u201D Darius said after hearing the verdict. \u201CA hit on our MRB rating is nothing compared to how this could have gone.\u201D\n\nI nod, agreeing with Darius. Still I feel bitter about the whole affair.",
