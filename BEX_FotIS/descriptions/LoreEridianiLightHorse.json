    "Name" : "The Eridani Light Horse",
    "Details" : "The Eridani Light Horse stands as one of the oldest and largest mercenary units in the Inner Sphere, with a rich history that predates the fall of the Star League. The unit's roots can be traced back to 2702 when the Third Regimental Combat Team was first formed.\r\n\r\nOn the day Kerensky departed with the SLDF, the unit members solemnly took down the Star League flag and lowered the Third Regimental Combat Team's standard to half-staff. This tradition, born in that moment, endures to this day. The headquarters maintains one bare flagpole, reserved for the future Star League flag, while the unit's flag continues to fly at half-staff in remembrance.",
