    "Details" : "Coordinator Takashi Kurita issued the \"Death to Mercenaries\" edict during the Fourth Succession War. Fueled by the humiliating defeat of DCMS forces by Wolf's Dragoons on Crossing in August 3029 and Jaime Wolf's personal insults to Takashi at the wedding of Hanse Davion and Melissa Steiner a year earlier, this decree mandated the outright execution of captured mercenaries.\r\n\r\n It also resulted in a substantial decline in mercenary hiring by the Combine for at least two decades.",
