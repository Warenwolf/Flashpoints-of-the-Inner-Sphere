    "Details" : "After the Free Rasalhague Republic declared independence on March 13, 3034, some Draconis Combine soldiers, defying orders from Kanrei Theodore Kurita, refused to accept this independence.\r\n They remained in the former Rasalhague Military District, engaging in conflicts with KungsArmé forces. \r\n\r\nThese renegades were labeled as 'Ronin' by Kanrei Kurita due to their dishonorable actions. The clashes between the KungsArmé and the experienced ronin were threatening the new realm's stability. With the consent of Elected Prince Haakon Magnusson, Kanrei Kurita led loyal DCMS regiments into the FRR to eliminate these masterless warriors. The confrontations between the ronin and loyal DCMS troops were often violent, driven by a desire to restore honor to the Combine. \r\nBy 3035, all DCMS forces had withdrawn to the newly-established Alshain Military District after successfully defeating the last of the ronin forces.",
