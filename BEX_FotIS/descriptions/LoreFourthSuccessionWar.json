    "Name" : "Fourth Succession War",
    "Details" : "In 3028, the leaders of the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere convened on the planet Terra to witness the union of First Prince Hanse Davion of the Federated Suns and Heir-designate Melissa Steiner of the Lyran Commonwealth. This momentous occasion would etch its mark in history books. Hanse, turning to his beloved wife, uttered now-famous words, saying, \"Wife, in honor of our marriage, in addition to this morsel... Here, my love, I give you the Capellan Confederation.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Davion troops had already initiated their offensive, surging across the border into the Capellan Confederation. Simultaneously, Lyran forces engaged the Draconis Combine on a broad front, thwarting the Dragon's attempt to exploit the situation on poorly defended Federated Suns border.\r\n\r\nThe following two years of conflict would reshape the entire Inner Sphere, resulting in the loss of over 100 million lives on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe Draconis Combine managed to seize 15 systems from the Federated Suns but suffered the loss of 53 systems to the Lyrians. The Free Worlds League was relatively less affected, losing 15 systems to the Lyrians. However, the Capellan Confederation bore the brunt of devastation, losing half of its territory, with one third falling under the control of the Federated Suns and two communities declaring their independence. Their forces were decimated and bulk of their industry systems was lost\r\n\r\nOn January 10th, Archon Katrina Steiner and Prince Hanse Davion jointly announced the cessation of offensive campaigns for their respective realms, leading to the final peace treaty on February 19th, signed by all parties involved, except for the Capellan Confederation.",
