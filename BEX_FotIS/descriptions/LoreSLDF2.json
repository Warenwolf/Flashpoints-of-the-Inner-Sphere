    "Name" : "Star League Defense Force",
    "Details" : "The Star League Defense Force (SLDF) was the primary military arm defending the Star League, a union of star systems within approximately 500 light years of Terra.\r\n\r\nAt its peak, the SLDF stood as the largest known military force, boasting over 100 million soldiers organized into 486 divisions. Following the Amaris Civil War, where Stefan Amaris seized power by overthrowing the ruling First Lord Richard Cameron, the SLDF departed the Inner Sphere.\r\n\r\nThe conflict, marked by numerous battles across the Star League, was resolved by Commanding General Aleksandr Kerensky, who liberated Terra and executed Amaris. However, the failure to agree on a new First Lord led to the dissolution of the Star League.\r\n\r\nIn response, Kerensky initiated Operation EXODUS, leading the surviving 113 divisions beyond the Inner Sphere in an attempt to preserve the essence of the League and avoid the internal strife that loomed ahead.",
