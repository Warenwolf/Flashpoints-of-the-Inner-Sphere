    "Details" : "The War of 3039 was a significant invasion of the Draconis Combine by the Federated Commonwealth, a coalition between the Federated Suns and Lyran Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nStemming from the Fourth Succession War, the alliance between House Davion and House Steiner had dealt a severe blow to the Capellan Confederation, prompting First Prince Hanse Davion to seek a similar triumph against the Combine.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the conflict commenced in early 3039, the allied forces fell short of their anticipated success, encountering unexpectedly resilient resistance and a bold counterattack led by Gunji-no-Kanrei Theodore Kurita. By the year's end, both sides had achieved minimal gains, and peace negotiations concluded the war. Nevertheless, its repercussions would resonate in the years that followed.",
