    "Details" : "The \"Com Guards\" grew out of the \"ComStar Guards and Militia\" organization, which served as the armed forces of ComStar.They became more widely known after the Fourth Succession War when they were employed as garrison troops for ComStar's HPG compounds. Unusually, they structure their forces based on multiples of six. The lowest unit, Level I, consists of one mech, combat vehicle, aerospace fighter, or infantry unit. Level II consists of six mechs, and so on.\r\n\r\nThey often deploy pristine mechs that haven't been seen in hundreds of years within the Inner Sphere and often make use of lostech equipment, making many wonder how they got their hands on such powerful equipment.\r\n\r\nThe current leader of Com Guards is Precentor Martial of ComStar, Anastasius Focht, who is responsible for Com Guards rapid expansion and reorganisation efforts",
