    "Details" : "Ryan Steiner, a second cousin to Archon Melissa Steiner, was a man of ambition and cunning who rose through the ranks of the Lyran Commonwealth. Initially an aerospace fighter ace, Ryan transitioned to politics in 3027, exchanging his military career for a more powerful position within Steiner's political circles. In order to gain further influence, he married into the Kelswa family of the Tamar Pact in 3034.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Fourth Succession War, Ryan was secretly mentored in politics by former Archon Alessandro Steiner. In 3029, he played a crucial role in exposing Frederick Steiner and Aldo Lestrade as traitors to then-Archon Katrina Steiner, positioning himself favorably within her court, despite his questionable loyalties. His actions during this time helped cement his place as a rising political figure.\r\n\r\nBy 3034, Ryan had become the leader of the Free Skye movement, a separatist faction in the Isle of Skye. He worked to foment secessionist sentiment in the region, ultimately leading the movement after the Skye Crisis when he was sent as a mediator between the separatists and the newly-formed Federated Commonwealth government during that vioence in 3034. In 3055, after Melissa Steiner was assassinated, Ryan Steiner blamed her son for the deed, plunging Skye Region into chaos and unrest",
