    "Name" : "The Free Skye Movement",
    "Details" : "The Free Skye Movement originated in 3025 when Aldo Lestrade, Duke of Summer and a prominent opponent of the Lyran Commonwealth, learned about the upcoming Steiner-Davion union. Enraged by this future alliance, Lestrade established an organization dedicated to the independence of the Federation of Skye.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 3027, Lestrade orchestrated an attempted kidnapping of Archon-Designate Melissa Steiner, followed by an assassination plot targeting both Katrina and Melissa Steiner in 3029. All of these attempts failed and Lestrade was ultimately killed by unknown parties a few months later.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing Lestrade's demise, his protégé Ryan Steiner, Duke of Porrima, assumed leadership of the organization. Under his guidance, the movement became more organized and influential as more and more Lyran nobles joined the opposition against the Steiner-Davion alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe initial uprising, known as the First Skye Rebellion, was sparked by the formation of the Free Rasalhague Republic. Although major demonstrations erupted, officially against Ryan Steiner's orders, they quickly turned violent. Prince Davion chose to suppress these demonstrations forcefully, resulting in hundreds of casualties caused by the AFFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Ryan Steiner initially maintained an official stance of non-involvement, he stepped in a standoff in 3034 and successfully negotiated a settlement between Davion soldiers and Skye separatists, thereby gaining significant political influence and simultaneously embarrassing Hanse Davion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the First Skye Rebellion ultimately failed, it strengthened Ryan Steiner's control over the organization.",
