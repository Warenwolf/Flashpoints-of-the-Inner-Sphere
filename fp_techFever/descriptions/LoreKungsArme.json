    "Details" : "The Royal Rasalhague Army, colloquially known as KungsArmé, serves as the military force of the Free Rasalhague Republic.\r\n\r\nDemonstrating notable competence despite its relatively brief existence as an active national force, the KungsArmé has faced renegade DCMS units during the Ronin War and has sustained an ongoing campaign against raiders and periphery pirates.\r\n\r\nThese experiences have contributed to shaping the force into an impressive and cohesive fighting unit..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges persist within the high command, particularly in terms of experience concerning the deployment and management of larger operations, such as multiregimental and combined-arms actions.",
