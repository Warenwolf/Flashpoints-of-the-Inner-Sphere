![uixTxrSpot_Ronin](https://github.com/Warenwolf/Flashpoints-of-the-Inner-Sphere/assets/136007621/5de1c072-52fb-4aa3-bb65-f259ff63e43d)


Welcome to Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere!

This repository features lore-inspired flashpoints set in the Battletech universe, taking place during the late Succession Wars era, specifically in the 3030s and 3040s. In the flashpoints "Smash and Grab" and "The Meatgrinder," you will participate in events and battles from the war between the Capellan Confederation and the Andurien-Canopian alliance.

On the other hand, the "Requiem for Ronin" flashpoint deals with the aftermath of the Ronin War. It focuses on people who refuse to accept their loss in the war and an unknown third party that provides financial support to them.

The flashpoints are designed for the Battletech game by Harebrained Schemes, which has the "BattleTech Extended 3025 - 3061" (BEX) mod installed. 
To see when the different flashpoints become available, head to [wiki](https://github.com/Warenwolf/Flashpoints-of-the-Inner-Sphere/wiki/Flashpoints:-Overview) where you will find details for the individual flashpoint.

If time and real life permits, I plan to expand this repository with additional flashpoints taking place in the time before the Clan invasion. 
If you are playing this during 3030s and 3040s in-game, I strongly advise use of my mod [News Events Expanded](https://github.com/Warenwolf/News-Events-Expanded) that adds 80+ news events between 3030 and 3045, all true to the cannon, and which give some background to the events during the flashpoints.

### Credits
This mod is bundled with another mod, [ExtendedConversations](https://github.com/CWolfs/ExtendedConversations), created by [CWolfs/Richard Griffiths](https://github.com/CWolfs). This mod gives advanced capabilites to the conversations aboard Argo such as varying conversation based on the timeline in the game, emulating passing of time and travel, etc, etc...

### Thanks
I am grateful to CWolf for his tools like "Conversetek", which was used to make conversations aboard Argo, and to Amechwarrior for the "Flashpoint Authors Guide" on Paradox forums, which provided valuable guidance (of the type - where to start??). <br>
Special thanks to CWolf (once again), t-bone, and Mal.D from CWolf's Mission Control discord for their assistance with technical issues during the making of the flashpoints.
