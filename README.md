# Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere

Welcome to Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere!

This repository features a lore-inspired flashpoints for the Battletech universe - "Smash and Grab" and "The Meatgrinder". 
Both depicit two battles during that the war between Capellan Confederation and the Andurien-Canopian alliance.
The flashpoints are designed for the Battletech game by Harebrained Schemes, which has the "BattleTech Extended 3025 - 3061" (BEX) mod installed. 
To see when the different flashpoints become available, head to [wiki](https://github.com/Warenwolf/Flashpoints-of-the-Inner-Sphere/wiki/Flashpoints:-Overview) where you will find details for the individual flashpoint.

If time and real life permits, I plan to expand this repository with additional flashpoints taking place in the time before the Clan invasion. 
If you are playing this during 3030s and 3040s in-game, I strongly advise use of my mod [News Events Expanded](https://github.com/Warenwolf/News-Events-Expanded) that adds 80+ news events between 3030 and 3045, all true to the cannon, and which give some background to the events during the flashpoints.

Prerequisites: Your Battletech game is up to date and you have BEX mod installed. The in-game time has not yet reached August 3031. 


* Extract the folders in the compressed archive
* Copy the folders and their contents to "Mods" folder which you will find in the same place
  where your Battletech game is installed.

### Dependencies
* The "Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere" are intended as an addition to [BattleTech Extended 3025-3061](https://discourse.modsinexile.com/t/battletech-extended-3025-3061-1-9-3-7/426) by Haree78. version 1.9.3.7.

### Credits
This mod is bundled with another mod, [ExtendedConversations](https://github.com/CWolfs/ExtendedConversations), created by [CWolfs/Richard Griffiths](https://github.com/CWolfs). This mod gives advanced capabilites to the conversations aboard Argo such as varying conversation based on the timeline in the game, emulating passing of time and travel, etc, etc...

### Thanks
I am grateful to CWolf for his tools like "Conversetek", which was used to make conversations aboard Argo, and to Amechwarrior for the "Flashpoint Authors Guide," which provided valuable guidance (of the type - where to start??). <br>
Special thanks to CWolf (once again), t-bone, and Mal.D from CWolf's Mission Control discord for their assistance with technical issues during the making of the flashpoints.
