# Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere

Welcome to Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere!

This repository features a lore-inspired flashpoint for the Battletech universe - "Smash and Grab". 
It depicts a raid at the beginning of the Andurien Crises on a recently occupied planet. The flashpoint is designed for the Battletech game by 
Harebrained Schemes, which has the "BattleTech Extended 3025 - 3061" (BEX) mod installed. 
It is set in 3031 and remains active for 480 days, aligning with the official canon's timeline of the Repulse system's occupation. 
With slight modifications, it can be adapted for other Battletech mods or the standard game.

If time and real life permits, I plan to expand this repository with additional flashpoints taking place in the time before the Clan invasion.

# Thanks
I am grateful to CWolf for his tools like "Conversetek" and to Amechwarrior for their "Flashpoint Authors Guide," which provided valuable guidance (of the type - where to start??). 
Special thanks to CWOlf (once again), t-bone, and Mal.D from CWolf's Mission Control discord for their assistance with technical issues.
