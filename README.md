# Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere

Welcome to Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere!

This repository features a lore-inspired flashpoint for the Battletech universe - "Smash and Grab". 
It depicts a raid at the beginning of the Andurien Crises on a recently occupied planet. The flashpoint is designed for the Battletech game by 
Harebrained Schemes, which has the "BattleTech Extended 3025 - 3061" (BEX) mod installed. 
It becomes available in September 3030 and remains active for 360 days, aligning with the official canon's timeline of the Repulse system's occupation
and miltary activities on that planet during that time. 
With slight modifications, it can be adapted for other Battletech mods or the standard game.

If time and real life permits, I plan to expand this repository with additional flashpoints taking place in the time before the Clan invasion. 
If you are playing this during 3030s and 3040s in-game, I strongly advise use of my mod [News Events Expanded](https://github.com/Warenwolf/News-Events-Expanded) that adds 80+ news events between 3030 and 3045, all true to the cannon, and which give some background to the events during the flashpoints.
