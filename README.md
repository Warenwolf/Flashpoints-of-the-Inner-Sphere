# Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere

Welcome to Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere!

This repository features a lore-inspired flashpoint for the Battletech universe - "Smash and Grab". 
It depicts a raid at the beginning of the Andurien Crises on a recently occupied planet. The flashpoint is designed for the Battletech game by 
Harebrained Schemes, which has the "BattleTech Extended 3025 - 3061" (BEX) mod installed. 
It becomes available in September 3030 and remains active for 360 days, aligning with the official canon's timeline of the Repulse system's occupation. 
With slight modifications, it can be adapted for other Battletech mods or the standard game.

If time and real life permits, I plan to expand this repository with additional flashpoints taking place in the time before the Clan invasion.

### Installation

Prerequisites: Your Battletech game is up to date and you have BEX mod installed. The in-game time has not yet reached August 3031. 


* Extract the folders in the compressed archive
* Copy the folders and their contents to "Mods" folder which you will find in the same place where your Battletech game is installed.
* If you are updating, chose yes when asked to overwrite. 

### Thanks
I am grateful to CWolf for his tools like "Conversetek" and to Amechwarrior for their "Flashpoint Authors Guide," which provided valuable guidance (of the type - where to start??). 
Special thanks to CWOlf (once again), t-bone, and Mal.D from CWolf's Mission Control discord for their assistance with technical issues.
