# Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere

Welcome to the the Flashpoints of the Inner Sphere!

Here you'll find a flashpoint inspired by the lore of the Battletech universe, depiciting a raid at the start of the Andurien Crises on a newsly occupied planet. 
This flashpoint is intended for the Battletech game, released in 2018 by Harebrained Schemes, which has "BattleTech Extended 3025 - 3061"  (BEX) mod installed.
It will appear in 3031 and will remain visible for 480 days which roughly represents the time of Repulse system's occupation according to the official cannon. 
Theoretically with small changes one can use it in every mod of the Battletech game or even the standard version. 

If time and real life permits, I intend to add more stuff to this repositor with objective is to expand upon the existing material while remaining faithful 
to the established canon. 

# Thanks
My limitations being what they are, I am indebted forever to CWolf and his tools like "Conversetek".
I also have to mention "Flashpoint Authors Guide" by Amechwarrior which pointed me into right direction.
Finally I have to thanks CWOlf, t-bone and Mal.D from CWolf's Mission Control discord for actually pointing me 
in right direction when I was stuck solving tech issues.
